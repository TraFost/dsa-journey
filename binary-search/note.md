# Binary Search

Binary search is an algorithm; its input is a sorted list of elements (I’ll explain later why it needs to be sorted). If an
element you’re looking for is in that list, binary search returns the position where it’s located. Otherwise, binary search
returns null.

Binary search only works when your list is in sorted order. For example, the names in a phone book are sorted in alphabetical
order, so you can use binary search to look for a name.
